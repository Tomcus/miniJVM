## About

This is implementation of JVM in C++.
I always wanted to write a VM and in the time of writing JVM had "better" documentation then WASM.
Also WASM is still in development and therefore subject to change.
All specification are read from the [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se17/html/jvms-4.html)
